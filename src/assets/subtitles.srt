Hello everyone, Welcome to the Milanam presentation. At Milanam,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,940
we are building an experience layer on top of NFTs.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,500
So, we are building token gated video rooms and audio rooms

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,460
where people can enter if they have a proof ownership 

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,760
of a particular NFT. They enter that room and they can experience something together 

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,500
they can create something together with that exclusive community.

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:32,650
So,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,620
how it works is that you know people can join or these video rooms they can 

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,639
do lots of stuff. They have like plugins to play games, stream videos 

10
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:50,840
work on white boards together you know the usual chatting audio, video we have those things you know

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,740
to addon to it. So, let's get into it like how it works 

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,760
the user connect their phantom wallet

13
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,370
once the wallet is connected oh you know we can go over to 

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,290
the dashboard which shows all the NFTs I own

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,800
and what sort of rooms I can create.

16
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,110
So, these are my NFT collections and I can create a room out of 

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,390
these

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,060
and that room will have this exclusive property that only people who 

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,640
own this NFT can join. So, if I want to create like a

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
the T-Shirt room

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,180
so, I can go here and you know i can set 

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,960
the room title, room description and other stuff. So, lets

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,230
add it here... I can do and create this meeting

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,740
then i can also join other live meetings which are happening on the platform

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,110
if they're happening...

26
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,790
and these are some of the previous meetings that I'd created. So, if I view these details

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,250
I can

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,260
joined this meetup

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,270
once i gave the appropriate permissions i get to join the room

30
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,970
and he we go so this is the video space where the interactions really

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:26,190
happens and then there is these plugins which I can add. We have you know remote browser 

32
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,010
,watching youtube videos and drawing, playing games and collaborating 

33
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,209
over white board or trello

34
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,730
so we have all these of plugins to go with it. So, this is like an exclusive space

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,230
which only the T-shirt NFT holders can only join.

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,190
So, this is the genesis product that we have 

37
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,270
But ...

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,710
the idea came to us when we are saving our own problem we have been building the floorgang 

39
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,790
community which is like a community of NFT collectors and investors for some time and 

40
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,690
we saw this problem when we interacted with dozens of NFT creators

41
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,409
who were running the communities

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,050
so that's how the idea of Milanam came about. And we are very excited

43
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,270
to paticipate in this hackathon and get get some solid feedback to build

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
the next big experience here layer on top of NFTs.

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,300
Thank You
